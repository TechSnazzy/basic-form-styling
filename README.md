# Form Style Notes

Following this [tutorial on YouTube fromRichard Barkinskiy](https://youtu.be/2ACrHs5o9LM).

1. Form gets a width, margin, border and padding to establish it's size.
2. The label is an inline element by default. So change it to block.
3. Do this for textarea and input as well.
4. Then give the inputs and textarea a width of 100%;
5. Change the body font.
6. Style the button.
7. The border on the input box makes it wider than the area it is contained in. So add this to make it fit: `box-sizing: border-box;`.
